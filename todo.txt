* Resolution independence:
    
    What currently depends on knowing the screen resolution?
    -   particle border collision
    -   Particles position is in screenspace, not viewspace
    -   framebuffers // this is needed tho
    -   quadtree size
    -   separate function for bound checking
    -   to_view_space function // needed

* Add a gradient background;


* Framerate independence:
